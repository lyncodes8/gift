As a start I really truly faithfully into u , nmout fik more than you can ever imagine  

u make me flourish  
like a thirsty flower which really needed a rare water composition  
a magical air “oxyasser” you only find in dreams  

u made me feel alive  
vivid, enlightened  

you paint me with every color  
one by one  
shade by shade  
making me even more beautiful, blossoming, glowing, glittering  

it’s like the air is cold  
soft, fresh when im with you  

it’s like sun’s radiance is pouring out of me  
shining and lighting everything around  

my soul feels lighter  
like a dancing feather with a tender wind  
it feels like flying  
freedom, floating  

crossing gentle white clouds which lovingly touching my skin  
and carrying it to the highest point  
to the summit in a golden sky  
where everything is heavenly  
relaxing, calming, serene—  

and at night u make me a star  
sparkling, shimmering  

and u gave me the ability of beautifying our days and moments  
like a star  
decorating the darkest, bluest night sky  

And when you make my heart race  
it became a meteor  
whispering to the wind that holds him close  
words that describes you the most  
wishing you can hear him whatever it cost  

racing too fast to look back  
excitedly moving forward  
burning through heavens  

cause he knows  
he will be reunited with his other half  
somewhere up  

and he knows u r too holy to be in this earth  
so he burns for you  

cause he never meant to land  
but destined to meet You  
in the prettiest form there at universe  
flaming, fiery and burning
